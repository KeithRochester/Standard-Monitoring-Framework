Linux Process Monitor. 

Can monitor:

* Number of instances of a process is within range
* Used Memory KBytes is below threshold
* Percent Busy Time is below threshold

Metrics that can be collected for dashboards/reports:

* Instance Count
* Used Memory KBytes
* Percent Busy Time 

## Adding Monitoring

To add a Linux Process Monitor...

* Create/update **/etc/opt/smf/scom/discovery/linuxprocess** on the agent that will execute the command. [Example CSV](https://github.com/KeithRochester/Standard-Monitoring-Framework/blob/main/Documentation/Example%20Files/linuxprocess.csv)
